Matrix.js - a file to hold your base Matrix data structure
Feel free to use a class you’ve already written in the past
GoldRush.js - here you’ll create your new matrix, it should extend from Matrix
Renderer.js - this will have your Renderer class with at least one method: renderBoard
The renderBoard method should receive a matrix, and display it on the screen
main.js - your controller file: this will load the initial game and react to user input
